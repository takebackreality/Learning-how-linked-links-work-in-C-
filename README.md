# Learning-how-linked-links-work-in-C-

In this repository, I wanted to learn how linked links work. Rather than understanding it conceptually, I also wanted to know how to actually build and traverse one in memory using pointers. Thus, this repository focuses on dynamic linking nodes, inserting new nodes at the end of a list using InsertAfter(), and traversing the list to print data.
